## Unraveling Patterns in the Philippine Lottery System Using Machine Learning Algorithms

### ABSTRACT
This study adopted machine learning (ML) techniques to further mine out patterns in the Philippine Small Town Lottery, disproving traditional views regarding randomness in lottery. Although lotteries account for huge contributions to revenue performance of the Philippine government, attention does draw towards the complexities of STL and potential of ML in detecting hidden patterns. With this, the data used for this study was obtained from the website STL Drawn for 2017 - 2023 using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and LSTM with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) models as a basis for analysis. The visualizations depict uniform number distribution yet showing challenges in predicting draw outcomes, revealing overfitting and randomness in STL draw results. The study reveals that there is a lack of discernible patterns in the STL draws, as LSTM and LSTM with CNN models struggle to predict lottery outcomes, which implies that STL draws follow the principles of randomness. Limitations include the constraints in the coverage of datasets and the exclusive deployment of particular ML models, thus increasingly calling for the necessity to explore wider models to broaden understanding.
